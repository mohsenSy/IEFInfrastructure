IEFInfrastrucure Project
========================

This project contains all the ansible playbooks used for configuring the
Virtual Machines running on the servers in the Information and Engineering
Faculty - Tishreen University - Syria.

There will be multiple playbooks for each service, the hosts file is not included
here it only exists on the system's administrator workstation along with the private
key used to access the servers.

I will add explanations for each playbook included here in the future.
